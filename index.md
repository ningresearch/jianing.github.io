## Welcome to My Github Page

Hi, my name is Jia Ning, and I am currently working as a postdoc in Department of Computer Science, Durham University. My research interest includes Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Image Processing.
Awarded a PhD degree from University of Warwick, I was doing research on biometrics and image/video related pattern recognition, concretely human identification by their gait patterns. My current project, funded by P&G, concerns the counterfeit analysis on the commodities under their names.
